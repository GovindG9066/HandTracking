# ✋ Hand Tracking Website

A modern web application that uses your webcam to **detect and track hand movements** in real-time.  
Built with lightweight technologies to deliver smooth and interactive gesture tracking!

---

## 📚 Overview

This project captures real-time video from the user's webcam and tracks hand landmarks (like fingers, palm center) using the **MediaPipe Hands** model.  
The application can detect finger movements, and you can extend it for interactive gestures like moving elements, zoom in-out, or controlling actions through hand signals!

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — For basic structure
- **CSS3** — For styling the interface
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** — For handling webcam access, hand detection, and logic
- **MediaPipe Hands API** — For detecting and tracking hand landmarks

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The browser asks permission to access your **webcam**.
2. Once allowed, real-time video is captured and analyzed.
3. **MediaPipe** model detects hand keypoints (landmarks) like fingertips, joints, and palm base.
4. Detected points are processed to perform actions (e.g., move an object, zoom a photo, etc.).
5. All updates happen live on the screen with minimal delay.
